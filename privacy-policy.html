  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: [7/21/2025]</em></p>

  <p>Stack ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect when you use our Stack clipboard manager browser extension, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clipboard Content:</strong> Stack automatically saves the text and images you copy or paste within the browser to help you organize your clipboard history. This data is stored locally on your device and is not sent to any servers by default.</li>
    <li><strong>Settings Data:</strong> Preferences such as workspaces, pinned items, dark mode, and language settings are stored locally.</li>
    <li><strong>AI Services:</strong> If you use the AI summarization feature, your clipboard content may be sent securely to the AI provider (e.g., Cohere) for processing. We do not store or share this data beyond the service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect or store personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, location, or browsing history.</li>
    <li>We do not track your activity outside of clipboard interactions within the extension.</li>
    <li>We do not sell or share your data with third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide clipboard management features such as history, organization, search, OCR, and AI summarization.</li>
    <li>To save your settings and preferences.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can clear your clipboard history at any time from the extension settings.</li>
    <li>You can disable AI summarization if you prefer not to share clipboard content with external AI providers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>All data is stored locally on your device. Data sent to AI services is encrypted during transmission.</p>
